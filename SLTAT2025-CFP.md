# SLTAT 2025: Call for papers

SLTAT 2025 Home page: <a href="https://sltat2025.github.io">https://sltat2025.github.io</a>

## 9th International Workshop on Sign Language Translation and Avatar Technology

Recent research in the use of avatars to animate sign language promises to provide increased accessibility for deaf people. In addition, avatars support sign linguistics research, providing a potential target for translation from spoken and other sign languages, and scan light on human factors of sign language usage.

Submissions are invited for a full-day workshop that aims to bring together researchers who work with sign language translation with those who develop sign language avatar technologies.

The workshop will take place within the Intelligent Virtual Agents IVA2025 (<a href="https://iva.acm.org/2025/" target="_new">https://iva.acm.org/2025/</a>) conference at the HTW campus (directly at the river Spree) in Berlin, Germany.

* Machine Learning and Multimodality
  * Mapping techniques between the visual domain and the linguistic annotations
  * Sign language annotation profiting from machine learning
* Translation Technologies
  * Use of corpora to inform translation

## Submissions

The revision process will be double blind (Anonymous authors, anonymous reviewers). So, **anonymize your submissions!**

Papers should contain a complete description of ideas and applicable research results in a **between 4 and 8 pages** for technical content including figures and possible references, and with **one additional optional page containing only references**.

Oral/signed presentations and posters (with or without demonstrations) have equal status.
Authors are encouraged to suggest the presentation format best suited to communicate their ideas, but the final presentation modality will be assigned by the program committee.

## Publication of Workshop Papers

The accepted workshop papers will be published via ACM as IVA 25 Adjunct Proceedings. Please note that the camera-ready workshop papers will be processed via the IVA 25 EasyChair and should be prepared in the “ACM Standard” format, more specifically the “SigConf” format (see instructions for the IVA full papers: <a href="https://iva.acm.org/2025/call-for-papers/" target="_new">https://iva.acm.org/2025/call-for-papers/</a>)
