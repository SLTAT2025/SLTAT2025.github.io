# SLTAT 2025: 9th Workshop on Sign Language Translation and Avatar Technologies

Recent research in the use of avatars to animate sign language promises to provide increased accessibility for deaf people. In addition, avatars support sign linguistics research, providing a potential target for translation from spoken and other sign languages, and scan light on human factors of sign language usage.

Submissions are invited for a full-day workshop that aims to bring together researchers who work with sign language translation with those who develop sign language avatar technologies.

The workshop will take place within the Intelligent Virtual Agents IVA2025 (<a href="https://iva.acm.org/2025/" target="_new">https://iva.acm.org/2025/</a>) conference at the HTW campus (directly at the river Spree) in Berlin, Germany.

The accepted workshop papers will be published via ACM as IVA2025 Adjunct Proceedings.

### Languages

The workshop languages are English and International Sign.

The oral/signed presentations will be interpreted into/from International Sign. The International Sign interpreters will also be around for the poster sessions to help out where necessary.

Deaf participants who prefer to bring interpreters for their national sign language are kindly encouraged to do so and to contact us well ahead of time so that we can plan the room accordingly.
